# Data Directory

This directory contains the data files used by the GSPHAR model:

- `rv5_sqrt_24.csv`: Realized volatility data for 24 markets, square-root transformed
- Other data files as needed for the model

The data preprocessing and loading are handled by functions in `utils/data_utils.py`.
