# GSPHAR Plots Directory Cleanup - COMPLETION REPORT

**Date:** 2025-05-28  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
**Space Reduction:** 445MB (70% reduction from 608MB to 163MB)

## Final Results Summary

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Total Size** | 608MB | 163MB | **-445MB (-70%)** |
| **Directories** | 24+ complex structure | 4 focused directories | **Streamlined organization** |
| **Focus** | Historical analysis | Active development | **Current models only** |

## Final Directory Structure

```
plots/ (163MB total)
â”œâ”€â”€ current/ (2.2MB)                    # 4 essential summary plots
â”œâ”€â”€ active_models/ (106MB)              # Current model development
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ current_comparisons/ (41MB)     # Latest model comparisons  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recent_trading/ (24MB)          # Trading strategy analysis
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ key_loss_analysis/ (42MB)       # Loss function optimization
â”œâ”€â”€ archive/ (53MB)                     # Minimal key milestones
â”œâ”€â”€ current_backup_20250528/ (2.2MB)    # Safety backup
â””â”€â”€ documentation files (8KB)
```

## Major Deletions (Space Freed)

| Directory | Size Freed | Reason |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| `data_exploration/` | 178MB | RV analysis not needed for current model development |
| `combined_plots/` | 42MB | Outdated model combinations |
| `analysis/` (most content) | 47MB | Consolidated into active_models structure |
| `experiments/` | 21MB | Historical experimental results |
| Historical archive folders | 92MB | Outdated timestamps and redundant content |
| Various smaller directories | 65MB | `interactive/`, `data_analysis/`, `ohlcv_analysis/`, etc. |

## Content Preserved

âœ… **All essential current model plots** (moved to organized structure)  
âœ… **Recent trading analysis** (May 24-26, 2025)  
âœ… **Key loss function comparisons** (for optimization work)  
âœ… **Current model comparisons** (active development)  
âœ… **Safety backup** of current directory  
âœ… **Key milestone documentation**

## Validation Results

- âœ… **Active models directory validated**: Contains recent files (May 24-26, 2025)
- âœ… **Current directory preserved**: 4 essential summary plots intact
- âœ… **Archive minimized**: Only key milestones retained
- âœ… **Space target achieved**: 70% reduction exceeded expectation
- âœ… **Organization improved**: Clear structure for rapid model development

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Faster Navigation**: Clear 4-directory structure vs. complex 24+ directory maze
2. **Development Focus**: Only content relevant to current model work
3. **Storage Efficiency**: 445MB freed for other project needs  
4. **Maintainability**: Simple structure easier to keep organized
5. **Performance**: Faster file operations and searches

## Usage Guidelines Post-Cleanup

- **Quick Assessment**: Use `current/` for immediate model performance review
- **Detailed Analysis**: Navigate `active_models/` by analysis type
- **Historical Reference**: Limited to `archive/key_milestones/` only
- **New Plots**: Follow established naming conventions with timestamps

## Success Metrics

ðŸŽ¯ **Primary Goal Achieved**: Aggressive space reduction for rapid model development  
ðŸŽ¯ **Organization Goal Achieved**: Clear structure focusing on active work  
ðŸŽ¯ **Preservation Goal Achieved**: All essential content maintained  
ðŸŽ¯ **Documentation Goal Achieved**: Clear usage guidelines established

---

**Cleanup Process:** 2-phase approach (conservative â†’ aggressive)  
**Safety Measures:** Backups created before deletions  
**Validation:** Content relevance verified before final structure  
**Documentation:** README.md updated to reflect new organization

**Result: GSPHAR plots directory now optimized for rapid model development with 70% less storage overhead.**
