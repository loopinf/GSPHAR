# Milestone 2: Two-Stage Training Breakthrough

**Date**: 2024-05-24  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED**  
**Impact**: üéâ **GAME CHANGER - SOLVED TRAINING FAILURE**

## üéØ Objective

Solve the complete training failure that occurred after fixing look-ahead bias by implementing a two-stage training approach.

## üö® Problem Statement

After fixing the look-ahead bias, the single-stage training approach completely failed:

- **Zero gradients**: Model weights weren't updating
- **Stuck predictions**: Volatility predictions remained at 0.0%
- **No learning**: Trading loss provided insufficient learning signal
- **Negative profits**: Expected returns became negative

The model couldn't learn the harder, realistic prediction task without future information leakage.

## üí° Solution Approach

### **Two-Stage Training Strategy**

#### **Stage 1: Supervised Learning Foundation**
- **Objective**: Train model to predict volatility accurately
- **Loss Function**: Standard MSE loss
- **Learning Signal**: Clear, unambiguous gradients
- **Goal**: Establish volatility prediction capability

#### **Stage 2: Trading Optimization**
- **Objective**: Fine-tune for trading profits
- **Loss Function**: Trading profit maximization
- **Learning Rate**: Lower (0.0005 vs 0.001) for fine-tuning
- **Goal**: Optimize pre-trained model for trading performance

## üîß Implementation Details

### **Key Script**: `scripts/train_two_stage_approach.py`

#### **Stage 1 Implementation**
```python
def train_stage1_supervised(model, train_loader, val_loader, device, n_epochs=10):
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
    
    for epoch in range(n_epochs):
        for batch in train_loader:
            vol_pred = model(*x_lags)
            mse_loss = F.mse_loss(vol_pred, vol_targets)  # Clear learning signal
            mse_loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
```

#### **Stage 2 Implementation**
```python
def train_stage2_trading(model, train_loader, val_loader, device, n_epochs=10):
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0005)  # Lower LR
    trading_loss_fn = OHLCVLongStrategyLoss(holding_period=4, trading_fee=0.0002)
    
    for epoch in range(n_epochs):
        for batch in train_loader:
            vol_pred = model(*x_lags)
            trading_loss = trading_loss_fn(vol_pred, ohlcv_data)  # Profit optimization
            trading_loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
```

### **Training Parameters**
